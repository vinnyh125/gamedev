/*
 * CollisionController.java
 *
 * Unless you are making a point-and-click adventure game, every single game is
 * going to need some sort of collision detection.  In a later lab, we will see
 * how to do this with a physics engine. For now, we use custom physics.
 *
 * This class is an example of subcontroller. A lot of this functionality could
 * go into GameEngine (which is the primary controller). However, we have
 * factored it out into a separate class because it makes sense as a
 * self-contained subsystem.  Unlike Lab 1, this controller stores a lot
 * information as fields. This is to keep us from having to pass the same
 * parameters over and over again.
 *
 * Based on the original AI Game Lab by Yi Xu and Don Holden, 2007
